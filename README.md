- Trend analysis for key metrics

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/users` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth` - User login

### Workout Plans
- `GET /api/v1/workouts/my-plan` - Get all workout plans
- `POST /api/v1/workout-plans` - Create new workout
- `PUT /api/v1/workout-plans/{id}` - Update workout
- `DELETE /api/v1/workout-plans/{id}` - Delete workout

### Goal Progress
- `GET /api/v1/goal/progress` - Get user goal progress data
- `POST /api/v1/goal` - Create workout goal

### InBody
- `POST /api/v1/user-in-body/import/upload` - Upload InBody scan
- `GET /api/v1/user-in-body/my-in-body` - Get InBody history

## Database Schema

Key tables include:
- `users` - User account information
- `workout-schedule` - Workout definitions and schedules
- `workout-exercises` - Exercise library
- `workout_logs` - Completed workout records
- `user-in-body` - Body composition and measurements
- `sms-notification` - SMS reminder

## OCR Integration

The application uses PaddlePaddle OCR to automatically extract data from InBody reports:

1. User uploads InBody scan (PDF or image)
2. Backend processes the document using PaddleOCR
3. Text recognition identifies key metrics (weight, body fat %, muscle mass, etc.)
4. Extracted data is parsed and stored in the database
5. User can review and confirm the imported data
